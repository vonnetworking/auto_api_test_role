The files subdirectory should house static files that need to be copied to devices during a playbook / role execution.

NOTE: for configuration or other files that may need different values by environment or server, please use the templates directory, as those files can use Jinja templating syntax for variable inclusion

For additional info about the use of this directory visit:
